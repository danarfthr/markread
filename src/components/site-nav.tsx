     *  2. It is also pointer-events-none. Without that it would be an invisible
     *     full-width strip swallowing every click in the top ~100px of the page.
     *  3. Sticky lives here, not on the pill: `position: sticky` is bounded by
     *     its containing block, so a w-fit pill inside a self-sized wrapper
     *     would never move.
     *
     * The inner flex row right-aligns the pill to the content column, matching
     * DESIGN.md's "floating dark pill anchored to the top-right".
